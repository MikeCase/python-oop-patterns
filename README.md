# python-oop-patterns

Some design patterns I sat down and tried to wrap my head around this weekend. 

I think if I could find real world use cases in something I'm doing it'd probably help solidify the concepts. 
But for now this is what I have. 

There's two singleton pattern files. One pattern, one template. The Template is about as generic as I could make 
the pattern so that it can be copy pasted and used.
